          As a user:
          (i would like to find a pet by zipcode
          so that i can find one near me)
          
          Are you ready to adopt your forever friend? This site allows you to find a pet based on your current zipcode. This allows
          you to find any pet near you now or a different zipcode of your choosing.
          
          As a user:
          (when the list is populated
          this service will give me the distance to the location of the pet from the zipcode i input)
  
          You've already completed the first step in just accessing this webpage! Next head to the mainpage and enter your zipcode.
          Once you submit your zipcode and the type of animal you are interested in, a list of results will pop up below to show you
          all of your options!
